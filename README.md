# xs3p 2.0

## What it is?
xs3p is a XSD documentation generator, this tool generates nice-looking HTML documentation from XML Schema descriptions.

This v2.0 is a fork of v1.1.5, by [bitfehler](https://github.com/bitfehler/xs3p), of the xs3p doc tool from http://xml.fiforms.org/xs3p/ (see the [original README](README_ORIG.txt) for more information).

Added features include:
 * Complete re-design using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com "Bootstrap homepage")
 * Output of UTF-8 encoded files
 * Output of HTML5
 * Support [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown homepage") formatting in `<documentation>` elements, powered by the [Pagedown library](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pagedown/ "Pagedown homepage")

You can see a nice example result [here](https://bitfehler.net/xs3p/address_annotated.xsd.html) which is the result of [one of the examples](examples/address_annotated.xsd "XSD source of the example") added specifically to demonstrate the new features of this fork.

Another interesting example is the [result for the XML Schema .xsd itself](https://bitfehler.net/xs3p/XMLSchema.xsd.html).
That one pushes the system to its limits, but it's still useful in my opinion.

## Install
### On Windows
You can use [MSXML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15697) and the [MSXSL command utility](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21714). 
To use MSXSL, place the downloaded EXE in the same folder as the ```xs3p.xsl``` file.

### On Linux

## How to use it?
### On Windows
Browse to folder, then type a command like this:

```
msxsl myXsd.xsd xs3p.xsl -o myXsdDocumentation.html
```

where ```myXsd.xsd``` is your XSD source file and ```myXsdDocumentation.html```, your output file.

You can also use the powershell script (```ConvertAllXsdToHtml.ps1```), wrote by [Amr](https://amreldib.com/blog/HowToTurnXmlSchemaXsdToDocumentation/). This one find all the XSD files in the folder where itâ€™s placed and convert them all to HTML. It assumes that both ```MSXSL.exe``` and ```xs3p.xsl``` are in the same folder. To use the script, from the command line run the following command:

```
powershell "& 'C:\XsdToBeConverted\ConvertAllXsdToHtml.ps1'
```

### On Linux
*TODO*

## Known issues
 * There is currently no way to inline the Bootstrap and jQuery sources, thus
   those files must be fetched when viewing the documentation. Their URLs can
   be set, though, so you could serve them locally if offline viewing is a
   requirement.
 * While I even added some features (e.g. linking to the `source` attribute of
   the `<documentation>` element, if present), some features that have
   previously worked may have gone missing. Quite some refactoring was involved
   and it is quite hard to test some of the more esoteric features of XSD.
 * There are some minor display issues, but as far as I can tell none of them
   impact the usability.
